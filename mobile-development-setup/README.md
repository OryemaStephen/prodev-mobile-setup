# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## üìå Objective
Mobile development requires more computational resources compared to web development.  
To simplify this process, we are using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which makes mobile app development and testing much easier.  

This repository documents the setup process for preparing your mobile development environment.

## ‚úÖ Requirements
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js LTS** (Latest Long-Term Support version)  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äì Recommended IDE  
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows  
- **Expo Go** on your physical mobile device (Android or iOS)  

These tools are essential for building and testing upcoming mobile projects.

## üì≤ Why Expo Go?
Unlike web development where you test apps directly in the browser, mobile apps typically require **emulators** or real devices.  
However, setting up emulators can be costly and resource-intensive.  

**Expo Go** offers a cost-effective and simple solution:  
- Run your React Native apps **directly on your physical device**  
- Works seamlessly on both **Android** and **iOS**  
- No need for heavy emulator setup
